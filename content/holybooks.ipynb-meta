Summary: This Jupyter notebook tool was developed to enable the visualisation of similarities and differences of the major texts from many of the worlds largest religions. It also includes non-religious works from approximately similar periods (of translation) as a benchmark. While the tool is focused on religious works, it is general enough to be applied to be used to visualize the comparison of books from any genre.
