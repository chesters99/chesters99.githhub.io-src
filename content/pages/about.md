Title: ABOUT

###Thank you for visiting!


Welcome to my blog, where I try to relate experiences and learnings in Data Science and the Python world.

In July 2016 I quit a well paying job at a major consultancy as a financial systems consultant with the intent to retrain in data science. Throughout my career I've enjoyed finding information in data, and now seemed the time to do something serious about it!

Update Dec 2017 - Half-way through Masters in Data Science at Monash University, Melbourne.
