Title: ABOUT

###Thank you for visiting!


Welcome to my blog, where I try to relate experiences and learnings in Data Science and the Python world.

In July 2016 I quit a well paying job at a major consultancy as a financial systems consultant with the intent to retrain in data science. Throughout my career I've enjoyed analysing data, and now seemed the time to do something serious about it. Still a way to go yet though...

Update Dec 2016 - Just started a Masters in Data Science at Monash University, Melbourne.
