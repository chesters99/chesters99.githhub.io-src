###Thank you for visiting!


Welcome to my data science blog, where I try to relate experiences and learnings from my data science and Python ecosystem studies.

In July 2016 I quit a well paying job at a major consultancy as a financial systems consultant with the intent to retrain as a data scienctist. Throughout my career I've enjoyed 'tinkering' with data, and now seemed the time to do something serious about it. Still a way to go yet though...
