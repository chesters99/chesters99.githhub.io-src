### Thank you for visiting!


Welcome to my blog, where I try to relate some experiences and learnings in Data Science and the Python.

In July 2016 I quit a well paying job at a major consultancy as a financial systems consultant with the intent to retrain in data science. Throughout my career I've enjoyed finding information in data, and now seemed the time to do something serious about it!

Update Dec 2017 - Half-way through Graduate Diploma in Data Science at Monash University, Melbourne.

Update Apr 2018 - Completed Graduate Diploma with straight HD's (A's).

Update Jan 2018 - Started Masters in Data Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

Update Nov 2018 - Masters nearly done, hoping for some great final results...
