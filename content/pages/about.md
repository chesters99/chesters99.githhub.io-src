###Thank you for visiting!


Welcome to my blog, where I try to relate experiences and learnings from my data science and Python ecosystem studies.

In July 2016 I quit a well paying job at a major consultancy as a financial systems consultant with the intent to retrain in data science. Throughout my career I've enjoyed analysing data, and now seemed the time to do something serious about it. Still a way to go yet though...
